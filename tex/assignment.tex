Determine whether the answer for test01.SWE is YES or NO and justify your solution. 

The answer for test01 is YES if $\forall t_i$ the expansion $e(t_i)$ is a substring of $s$. Every $t_i$ is some number of uppercase characters and the expansion is defined as the concatenation of the different expansions for each upper case character $\gamma_i$. Each $e(\gamma_i)$ can be any word of the set $R_i$. 

The test01 is small enough to be solved by hand. $s := \texttt{abdde}$ $k=4$

For each $R_i$ the different expansions are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The ABD can expanded from a,b,d to abd
    \item The DDE can expanded from d,d,e to dde
    \item The AAB can expanded from a,b,d to abd
    \item The ABd can expanded from a,b,d to abd
\end{itemize}

All of these elements are substrings of $s$. Therefore the solution to test01 is YES.

\subsubsection{Running time}
Let there be $m$ number of subsets $R_i \in \Sigma*$. For $t_i$ the number of different expansions for $e(\gamma_i)$ is $O(n)$ where $n$ is the $max_i |R_i|$. The total number of expansions $e(t_i)$ is therefore $O(n^m)$.
